	<p>Assuming that you already know how to operate a computer, I recommend you to learn <strong>"The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery"</strong> by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreineagoie/" target="_blank"><strong>Andrei Neagoie</strong></a>. Embrace adaptability and dive right into! After all it is never too late to learn something new.
